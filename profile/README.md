# Endless AddOns

A repository for 3.3.5 AddOns compatible with [Endless.gg](https://endless.gg).

---

To request an AddOn to be added to the repository, use the request form [under this link](https://github.com/endless-addons/.github/issues/new/choose).  
If you'd like to contribute to the AddOn repository, you can do so by submitting a pull request.  

If there's already an open issue requesting the AddOn you're interested in, please avoid creating a duplicate request.  
Instead, you can show your support by leaving a üëç (thumbs up) reaction on the existing issue.  
This helps prioritize which AddOns to consider next.
